        <h3 class="post-title">Charleston, South Australia</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="town-description">Charleston is a small town in the Adelaide
            Hills of South Australia. It is situated on the Onkaparinga Valley Road
            between Woodside and Mount Torrens, on the main route from the Adelaide
            Hills to the Barossa Valley, and 3km south-east of Lobethal. Charleston
            is very close to the source of the River Onkaparinga.</p>

          <p class="blog-content">Twas the night after the pandemic and Adelaides
          cases weren't surging. Parkrun AU hadn't made a decision to cancel them,
          but they weren't far off. Little did we know this would be our last parkrun
          of 2020. The sun was shinning, but the air was cold. We headed through the Adelaide
          Hills to the town of Charleston. A short walk from the carpark lead us to the
          section of trail where it's ran. We had to keep moving to stay warm, but once we were
          away it was easy! A few gentle underlations on an out and back made this course fairly
          easy and a pleseant final parkrun!
        <br>
        <br>
          Everyone was quite rugged up and was keeping the themselves so we didn't feel
          a sense of community, but I don't doubt that it's there! Its an easy Parkrun in a
          scenic part of the Adelaide Hills. Definitely worth checking out if you're ever in
          the area!</p>
