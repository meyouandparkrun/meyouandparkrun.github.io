         <p class="course-description">This is a flat 5km loop course that follows
           the Stockton foreshore walking track taking in views of the Hunter River,
           Newcastle Harbour, Nobbys Lighthouse and Stockton Beach.
           The course begins to the east of the iconic Stockton Ferry at the end of
           Mitchell St and curves across the grass and turns eastward towards the ocean.
           Following the foreshore walking track along Newcastle Harbour past the Lions
           Park and playground with views of Nobbys Headland and Lighthouse. Veering left
           at the split in the path takes you up the ‘hill’ where the detour rejoins
           the original path. The course loops back at the metal path divider before the
           carpark and Stockton Breakwall. Travelling back, veer left at the split which
           returns us towards the ferry terminal. Continue past the ferry terminal along
           the harbour towards the Stockton boat ramp and Sailing Club with its many resident
           pelicans. The track continues along the path to the turnaround point just past the
           Stockton Scout Hall. Return is via the boat ramp and ferry terminal to finish at
           the start/finish line.</p>

      <p class="course-description">The is one of the most scenic courses you will
        find on the Global parkrun map. Overlooking one of the most popular surf
        beaches in the area, the parkrun will give the runners and their families
        and friends a wonderful experience each Saturday morning.
        The course is a one lap anti-clockwise that starts by the park’s kiosk and
        heads slightly north before going down a grass car track to the beach.
        Runners will then run along the beach for approximately 300m before heading
        back to a track that takes them around the eastern side of the lagoon. This
        also takes the runners up a 20m climb over 300m before it flattens out around
        the Northern end of the lagoon. The run then descends around to the Western
        side of the lagoon.
        The run then turns right and heads up a vehicle track to the Western side of
        the park near the park entrance. The vehicle track is approximately 1km long
        and climbs about 40m.
        Runners then follow the inside of the driveway fence remaining on the grass
        and head back to the finishline near the Kiosk.</p>
