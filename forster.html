        <h3 class="post-title">Forster, New South Wales</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="town-description">Forster is a coastal town in the Mid North
            Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, in the Mid-Coast Council LGA,
            about 308 km north-north-east of Sydney. It is immediately adjacent to its
            twin, Tuncurry, which is the smaller of the two towns. Forster is known for
            its stunning waters & Manning Valley beauty. At the 2016 census, the
            Forster-Tuncurry area had a population of 19,918 people, while the permanent
            population of Forster alone was 13,740.</p>

          <p class="blog-content">After a week of false starts due to the ongoing
            bushfire crisis, it was finally safe for us to drive. The devaston was
            crazy and we still saw spot fires burning unattended.
         <br>
            We were at Forster during their X anniversary, and the local bowls club owner
            provided a variety of cakes for everyone. This made the finish line even
            tastier than usual. This course was quite calm as it was run on gravel trails
            and had good views of the oceanside. The path was a good size, with only a few
            non parkrunners. There is one main undulation before the turn around point, but coming
            back down right away gives you a breather.</p>
