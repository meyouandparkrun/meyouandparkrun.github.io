            South Australia. It is the seat of the City of Salisbury, and in the South

          <p class="blog-content">We felt like trying one of Trents more 'local'
            Parkruns and decided to give Carisbrooke a try. We didn't have high expectations
            as it's located on the outskirts of some more questionable suburbs, so were
            blown away with this underated course!

            The trail is mostly gravel and folows a stream for the good majority. The course is
            on the lower side of the stream so we were shaded on both passes. The park itself
            is quite large and well mantained, with large sections of green grass
            and well established tress providing good coverage. Someone bought their
            golden retriever along and had it wear a volunteer vest. It was super friendly
            and very pattable.</p>
          <p class="results">Trent: 6th place @ 23:59 (5th male & 1st in age category)
            <br>
              Sara: 10th place @ 25:22 (2nd female & rd in age category)</p>
